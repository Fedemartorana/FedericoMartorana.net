<strong>about</strong>
      I am a graduating student in Architecture at Politecnico di Milano, where I have focused on the relationship between architecture and the visual arts, with particular attention to the intersections between architecture and sculpture—the subject of my thesis. Alongside this academic research, I have worked for several years in architecture studios, gaining professional experience in design, representation, and technical development, combining critical inquiry with a concrete and multidisciplinary practice.
