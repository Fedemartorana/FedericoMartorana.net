Bachelor Thesis in Architecture

<strong>Abstract</strong>
We lost ourselves between a wall and an idea, in a liminal space where matter and intention blur. Eight works—four architectures and four sculptures—are analyzed not by form or chronology, but through thematic resonances: life, relations, experience, and perception. The aim is not to compare architecture and sculpture, but to explore the space generated between them, a dynamic field that engages both body and mind, transforming the observer and the way the world is perceived. Each work thus becomes a phenomenological machine, an enigma that invites new readings of space, the body, and consciousness.
