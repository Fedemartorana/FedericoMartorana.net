<strong>why</strong>
Starting from the concept of “hypogeo” as an underground space,  
used as a place of worship or burial.  

With *Hypogeum*, the aim is to draw attention to the climate crisis.  In a new, original, and experimental way, considering the modern role of emotions evoked by the experience of architecture.
Located in a symbolic place for the city of Milan: the Indro Montanelli public gardens, in dialogue with the building, the architect, and the architecture of the Hoepli Planetarium. The latter represents the emblem of the study of the stars, a terrestrial phenomenon, yes, but physically distant from our reality and, despite its importance and fascination, with little influence on human life.

The intent is, therefore, to shift the gaze not only to the celestial vault but rather to the tangible and concrete condition of climate disasters. The project consists of a hemispherical excavation—the negative of the planetarium’s dome—ideally formed by the corrosion of the earth caused by humans.
Around the excavation, public spaces and buildings develop radially (a circular plaza, research laboratories, restaurants, residences); a built element is thus introduced within the park without obstructing the view of it from the outside, thanks to the use of the ha-ha landscape feature.
The focal point engages in dialogue with the surrounding environment through fully accessible pedestrian paths leading in all major directions, all executed with the intent of preserving and enhancing the picturesque character of the garden.  

The gravitational center of the entire project is the new planetary hall located beneath the excavation. 

<strong>sublime</strong>
From the Latin *sublimis*, composed of *sub-*, “under,” and *limen*, “threshold”;  
In aesthetics, the quality of art to induce a state of ecstasy through its connotations of mystery and ineffability, and its ability, in conflict with rationality, to provide emotional awareness of the infinity and irresistible power of nature.

An austere, sublime, and dark environment where emotions are extracted and become an integral part of the architectural experience.  
The space is freed from any superfluous elements. 
The built form is reshaped by natural light as it seeks to reclaim the space.  
The culmination is reached at the center, the cusp of the inverted dome, the only point where the continuity of the hemisphere is broken by an oculus through which a parallel and distorted reality can be admired.
