<strong>why</strong>
The project is based on clear and paradigmatic choices, shaped through a continuous dialogue with the urban context. The architectural concept evolves by integrating external influences into formal and typological structures.  
The intervention consists of an articulated system combining different functions: an exhibition space on a plate structure, an archive in morphological continuity with it, and a linear residential building aligned with the neighborhood’s typology.  
Its foundation lies in the juxtaposition of a plate-like base and a slender, rational perpendicular axis. The connection with the former QT8 market—now CASVA—through a linear portico reactivates its urban presence and links it to the new structure


The project juxtaposes mass and permeability, balancing the solidity of the base plate with the lightness of transitional elements.
The exhibition plate, a monolithic exposed concrete volume, grounds the intervention while integrating internal courtyards that open the space to the city, fostering an open museum concept. 

Rather than a closed enclosure, it acts as a permeable platform, where calibrated openings enhance the relationship between interior and urban space.
